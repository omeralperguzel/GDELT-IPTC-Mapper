We identified the most frequent GDELT theme families for each country and retained those that consistently appeared across all six countries and corresponded to meaningful news topics.

Metadata-only tags (TAX, WB, USPEC, etc.) were filtered out as they represent GDELT's internal classification rather than actual news content.

To ensure robust sentiment aggregation, we required at least 50 distinct news records per country–theme–month.

Categories with monthly coverage ≥70% were used for monthly sentiment analysis; those with 40-70% coverage were aggregated quarterly; below 40% were excluded.

All analyses were performed using unified monthly detail data to ensure consistency across total document counts, quality metrics, and coverage calculations.
